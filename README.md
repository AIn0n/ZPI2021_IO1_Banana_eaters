## Technologies

We use streamlit library to create this site. It gives us enough flexibility to prepare all required functionalities without splitting project at classical, three pillars architecture - frontend, backend and database. This makes our development time much faster and codebase easier to maintain, cause everything is written in one language.

## Dev ops platform

We are using github actions as a main place for developing pipeline - mostly for running automated tests before each merge.This gives us the peace of mind and ensures that no existing functionality is broken by new commits. You can check the details [here](https://github.com/IIS-ZPI/ZPI2021_IO1_Banana_eaters/actions).

## MVP
Functionalities demanded for the minimal value product are listed in this [file](https://github.com/IIS-ZPI/ZPI2021_IO1_Banana_eaters/blob/readme/technical_requirements.pdf).
